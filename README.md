# Narrative Mark

A Markup language specification built with the purpose of representing the raw format of written
works. It's intended to be used as the backing format for creating an IDE for writing and editing
novels.

- [spec/narrative-mark-spec.md](/spec/narrative-mark-spec.md) contains the base specifications for the file format.
- [spec/narrative-mark-extended.md](/spec/narrative-mark-extended.md) contains an extended specification, adding more features.
- [/parser/](/parser) contains the Rust based parser library to be used with clients working with this format.
